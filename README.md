## The project

Disignasaur is a dino creation simulator a la Jurassic Park. Craft your custom dino using various genetic materials on hand. Your dino will be incubated, and hatch. There you will decide it's species name. From there you can release your dino onto Isla FooBar and watch them interact and move about the Island. 

## Our purpose

Everyone wants to live out their dreams of being a dino crazed mad scientist and Designasaur can give you that experience. This application is for your enjoyment and entertainment. Please enjoy!

## The stack

This project was made with only vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML - no additional libraries and frameworks are needed!
